# Concurrent Task Scheduler
**Overview**: The application will act as a task scheduler, where multiple tasks can be submitted and processed concurrently. Tasks could be executed with different priorities, and the scheduler will manage them using data structures like priority queues and a worker pool.

## Core Components:

**Priority Queue:** A priority queue to hold tasks. Higher-priority tasks are executed before lower-priority ones.

**Worker Pool:** A pool of worker threads (or fibers) that will pick tasks from the queue and process them concurrently.

**Task Submission Interface:** A function to submit new tasks, assigning them a priority. This could involve several clients submitting tasks simultaneously.

**Task Processing:** Workers will concurrently execute tasks.

**Concurrency Management:** Uses Eio's concurrency primitives to manage tasks, ensuring proper synchronization and avoiding race conditions.

## Setup:

**Initialize dune project**

`dune init <project_name>`

**Add Dependencies:** In your dune file, add the necessary dependencies, including eio. You might also want to add base for easier list and queue management.

```
(executable
  (name <project_name>)
  (libraries eio base))
```

## Code

**Implement Priority Queue:** Implement a priority queue using a heap. Tasks can be represented as a tuple containing the task's function and its priority.
